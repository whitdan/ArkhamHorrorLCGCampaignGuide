        고요하고 형언할 수 없는 분노가 마을을 지배하고 있다. 사람들은 걸핏하면 화를 내는 일이 잦아졌고,
        지난 주에만도 단순한 오해를 둘러싼 마을 사람들의 과격한 폭행에 대한 수많은 보고가 있었다.\n
        \n그리고 지금, 제임스 핸커슨에게서 전화가 왔다. 그는 자신의 헛간에서 해체된 유해를 발견했다고 말했다.\n
        \n날씨를 탓하는 것은 너무 쉬운 해결책이다. 마을에 뭔가 이상한 점이 있다. 그렇지만 이 늙은 점쟁이가 이 흐름을 막기 위해 할 수 있는 것은 많지 않다.
        점을 친 결과, 작은 조사자 그룹이 곧 이 이상한 사건에 주의를 기울일 것이고, 이를 바로잡기 위해 출발할 것이라고 한다.
        나는 그들의 행보를 지켜보겠지만, 그러나 그리 기대하지는 않을 것이다.</string>

        지난 몇 주 동안, 여러 마을 사람들이 불가사의하게 실종되었으며 최근에는, 짐승에 의해 공격당하고 반쯤은 먹혀버린 그 사람들의 시체가 숲에서 나타났다.
        경찰과 신문은 야생 동물 탓이라고 했지만, 당신들은 다른 일이 벌어지고 있다고 믿는다. 당신은 이 기괴한 사건을 논의하기 위해 수석 조사관의 집에 모여 있다.</string>

        그녀는 문 앞에 있던 의자를 밀어 문 손잡이 아래에 끼워 문이 열리지 않게 막는다.
        \"여기서 나가야 돼. 따라와. 내가 아는 걸 알려주지. 우리가 도시 전체에 도사리고 있는 위협이 풀려나는 것을 막아야 돼.\"
        논쟁 할 상황이 아니다. 고개를 끄덕이면서, 당신은 현관에서 리버 타운쪽을 향해 비가 오는 길로 달려가는, 그 여자를 따라간다.\n

        \"나와 함께 가지.\" 여자가 말한다. \"당신은 도사리고 있는 위협에 대해 반드시 들어야만 해. 우리는 파멸될거야... 하지만 같이 해보면, 막을 수 있을 거야.\"\n

        지난주였다면 그녀가 미치광이라고 생각했을 것이다. 하지만 최근의 사건들은 정상적이라는 것에 대한 당신의 선입견에 도전하는 것들이었다.\n
        당신은 그녀의 말을 듣기로 결심했다. 그 여자는 리타 챈틀러(lita chantler)라고 자신을 소개하고 당신의 믿음의 한계를 확대시킬만 한 이야기를 시작한다.

        나는 그것들의 움직임을 추적하고 도시 전체에서 미친듯이 날뛰는 것들을 막기 위해 최선을 다했어.
        하지만 뭔가 더 나쁜 일이 일어나고 있는 것 같아. 이 종교단체는 내가 아직 보지 못한 것보다 더 어둡고 불길한 무언가를 계획하고 있을거야.
        이 계획은 오늘 밤 자정 직후에 결과가 나올 것 같아. 그 뒤로는, 나는 무슨 일이 일어날 지 짐작할 수도 없어."
        \n\"이 종교단체의 많은 사람들은\" 리타가 계속한다. \"흉악한 속내에도 불구하고 보통 사람들처럼 보일 거야. 이들은 모일 때마다 회원들은 서로의 신원을 감추기 위해

        아캄에서의 미친 듯한 야간 수색을 한 뒤, 당신은 종교단체의 여러 멤버들을 추적하여 질문을 했다.
        당신이 찾아낸 것은 다음과 같다: 그들은 다른 차원의 괴물인 우모르도스로 알려진 것을 숭배한다고 한다.\n
        \n당신들은 리타의 이야기 중 많은 부분을 확인할 수 있었다: 컬트는 구울 굴의 파괴에 대해 동요하고 있다.
        그러나 놀라운 세부 사항이 또한 나타났습니다: 은신처를 침범하고 오늘 밤 행사를 설정한 사람은 리타 챈틀러 자신이었습니다!
        당신들은 리타의 이야기에서 왜 이 중요한 부분을 생략했는지 확신 할 수 없습니다 - 그 여자는 당신을 이 충돌에 빠뜨리는 데 필요한 만큼만 말한 것인가?
        그러나 달리 보면, 그녀는 끔찍한 위협으로부터 아캄의 도시를 보호하기 위해 싸우고 있는 것처럼 보입니다.\n
        \n퍼즐의 마지막 조각은 종교 단체의 숭배자들 중 한 명이 소유한 저널에 쓰여 있었다. 그 저널은 아주 어두운 밤에 아캄 남쪽 숲속에서 수행해야 할 어둠의 의식을 묘사하고 있었다.
        저널에 따르면, 의식의 완성은 문을 열어 종교단체의 어둠의 주인을 이 세상으로 불러올 것이라고 한다.
        \"만약 그 종교단체의 숭배가 멈추지 않으면,\" 리타는 경고하듯 말한다. \"우모르도스의 복수가 그 앞에 있는 모든 것을 빨아들일 가능성이 있어.\"

    <string name="dunwich_setup"><b>Prologue</b>\n
    \nDr. Henry Armitage pours himself a glass of pinot and sits down at his desk, gesturing for you to sit
        across from him. \"I apologize for the short notice,\" he begins. His face is pale, his forehead sweaty
        and wrinkled with worry.\n
    \nArmitage - the head librarian of Miskatonic University, and a former mentor of yours - privately
        contacted you in the hopes of gaining your assistance. Eager to help, you made your way to his home in
        Southside. Upon entering, you were surprised to find his home in disarray. Books and notes litter his
        desk, and an empty bottle of wine has tipped over onto the ground by the fireplace. You\'d always known
        Armitage to be neat and well-organized.\n
    \nThe elderly man takes a moment to collect his thoughts. \"I am looking for two of my colleagues - Dr.
        Francis Morgan, professor archaeology, and Warren Rice, professor of languages. Warren was supposed to
        meet up with me over supper earlier today to discuss several important findings, but he has since gone
        missing. At first I thought nothing of it, but I have a nagging feeling something else is going on. A
        very&#8230;<b>familiar</b> feeling.\" You\'ve never seen Armitage quite this worried before. His hands
        tremble as he reaches for the glass on his desk, and he sips from it nervously. \"I tried to find
        Francis, hoping he knew where Warren was, but he too is out of touch. Francis has been spending a lot
        of time in some gambling den, or so I am told.\n
    \n\"I sent for you because I am worried Warren might be in trouble. I would appreciate it greatly if you
        could find him for me. You may also wish to ask Francis for help, if you can reach him.\"</string>

    <string name="extracurricular_setup"><b>Scenario 1-A: Extracurricular Activity</b>\n
    \nDr. Armitage is worried his colleague, Professor Warren Rice, might be in trouble, so he has asked for
        your help in finding his friend. He seems unreasonably nervous about his colleague\'s disappearance,
        considering Professor Rice has only been \"missing\" for a matter of hours&#8230;</string>

        been stalking him for hours. They cornered him in his office and tied him up, although for what
        purpose, Rice isn\'t sure. You inform him that Dr. Armitage sent you, and Rice looks relieved, although
    he suspects that Dr. Morgan might be in danger as well. Because the strangers on campus seem to have been
        targeting Professor Rice, you decide that the best course of action is to escort him away from the
        campus as quickly as possible. As you leave the university, you hear screaming from the northern end of
    the campus. An ambulance passes you by, and you fear for the worst. Hours later, you

        are confused and exhausted, but you believe an attempt to explain the situation will do more harm than
        good. Minutes later, a terrible screech echoes across the campus, piercing and shrill. You tell the
        students to wait and head back to the dormitories to investigate. Oddly, you find no trace of the
        strange creature - a prospect that worries you more than it relieves you. You hurry to the faculty
        offices to find Professor Rice, but there is no sign of him anywhere.</string>

    <!--Scenario 1-B - The House Always Wins-->
    <string name="house_setup"><b>Scenario 1-B: The House Always Wins</b>\n
    \nDr. Armitage suggested you track down his associate Dr. Francis Morgan. He\'s not sure whether Dr. Morgan
    is in trouble, but he\'s not particularly happy with his colleague\'s present choice of company. He\'s in
        the Clover Club, a notorious gambling joint somewhere downtown. Finding the club\'s exact location
        isn\'t easy - you have to grease a few palms just to learn which of the Downtown restaurants operates
        as the club\'s front. That restaurant is La Bella Luna, a somewhat upscale Italian eatery by the
        theatre. You change into your Sunday best and make your way there.\n
    \nIn front of La Bella Luna stands a man in a pinstripe suit who sizes you up as you approach. \"Enjoy
        yourselves,\" he says with a snake-like grin as he holds open the restaurant\'s front door.</string>

    <string name="house_sets">The House Always Wins, Bad Luck, Naomi\'s Crew, and Rats.</string>
    <string name="house_set_aside">The Hideous Abominations and Striking Fear encounter sets.\n</string>

    <string name="house_additional">Put Clover Club Pit Boss into play in the Clover Club Lounge.\n</string>

    <string name="house_resolution_one">You flee to the end of the block and pause to recover. Before you can
        catch your breath, the ground shakes with a thunderous crash. People emerge from their homes and
        storefronts to see what the ruckus is, and a crowd forms on the street. You head to the front of the
        crowd and are horrified to see the building from which you fled just minutes earlier reduced to rubble.
        There is no sign of Dr. Morgan anywhere.</string>
    <string name="house_resolution_two">\"What in the world&#8230;?\" Dr. Morgan finally breaks out of his daze
        as you make your way to safety. You ask him what he remembers, and he sputters and shakes his head.
        \"It\'s all a haze,\" he explains, visibly exhausted. \"I was having the run of my life! Perhaps I had
        one too many shots. But, those creatures - I haven\'t seen anything like that since&#8230;\" He trails
        off, and you can tell that his mind is racing. His eyes widen with realization and his face pales. \"I
        may not be in the best shape, but I\'ll help with your investigation. Whatever it takes.\"\n
    \n<b>Any one investigator may choose to add Dr. Francis Morgan to his or her deck.</b></string>
    <string name="house_resolution_three">Although you were unable to find Dr. Morgan in the club, the man you
        rescued is grateful for your help. He introduces himself as Peter Clover, the owner of the
        establishment you\'d just left. Despite the situatin, he maintains an air of quiet professionalism. As
        you make your way towards the street, a well-polished Chrysler B-70 rolls up to you, and a gorgeous
        woman with long brown hair and narrow eyes exits. She is flanked by dangerous-looking men who slip
        their hands under their suit jackets when they see you. \"Peter,\" she says with a sigh of relief,
        \"Good, you\'re okay. I heard there was trouble?\" She turns and glares at you with deadly eyes. \"Who
        are they?\"\n
    \nMr. Clover dusts off his vest, unworried. \"Naomi, my dear, these are friends of mine. They&#8230;\" he
        clears his throat. \"They escorted me off the premises,\" he explains after a short pause. \"They have
        earned our gratitude.\" The woman crosses her arms and takes a moment to size you up before giving you
        a smirk.\n
    \n\"Very well then. I must thank you for taking care of Peter. Run along now; we\'ll handle things from
        here.\" She nods to the goons flanking her and they walk past you toward the club\'s rear entrance,
        pulling firearms out from underneath their coats. You\'re not sure what \'handling things\' means, but
        you\'re pretty sure you don\'t want to be here when the gunfire starts. You thank Naomi and Peter, and
        head off.</string>
    <string name="house_resolution_four">You are pulled from the debris by several firefighters, on of whom
        exclaims, \"We\'ve got a live one!\" A few of them patch you up, and the cops ask you what happened.
        You\'re certain they wouldn\'t believe your story about horrible monstrosities demolishing the building
    from within. Unsure of what to say, you give a vague statement about not remembering much. \"We\'re
        bringing you to St. Mary\'s,\" one of the nurses says, pointing to a nearby ambulance. Knowing now how
        dire the situation is, you slip away while she is distracted by something else in the rubble&#8230;</string>


    <!--Interlude 1: Armitage's Fate-->
    <string name="dunwich_interlude_one_text"><b>Armitage\'s Fate</b>\n
    \nYou are more than a little rattled by your experiences in the university and the Clover Club. You\'re not
        sure what to make of whoever - or whatever - was after Rice and Morgan. Worried about Dr. Armitage, you
        swiftly make your way back to his home. When you arrive, you find that the latches of his front door
        have been busted open, and his living area and study have been ransacked. Dr. Armitage is nowhere to be
        found. Searching his home, you find a journal the intruders didn\'t steal tucked beneath several other
        documents in the bottom drawer of Armitage\'s desk. The journal appears to be written in a strange
        language you cannot decode, using a script you\'ve never seen in your entire life. Fortunately, it
        seems Dr. Armitage had already gone through the trouble of translating it into English. Apparently, it
        belongs to one \"Wilbur Whateley.\"\n
    \nThe journal - along with Armitage\'s many notes - tells a startling tale, one you would scarcely believe
        had it not been for your harrowing experiences earlier tonight&#8230;</string>
    <string name="dunwich_interlude_two_text"><b>Armitage\'s Fate</b>\n
    \nWhen you arrive at Dr. Armitage\'s home in Southside, you find him sitting at his desk, pale-faced and
        sweating with worry. He is grateful to you for searching for his colleagues, but he doesn\'t look
        relieved. With a long pause, he straightens his glasses and explains:\n
    \n\"I\'m afraid I must apologize. There\'s something I didn\'t mention to you earlier.\" Dr. Armitage then
        spins a tale that you would scarcely believe had it not been for your harrowing experiences earlier

    <string name="miskatonic_setup_a"><b>Scenario 2: The Miskatonic Museum</b>\n
    \nSeveral months ago, Armitage and his colleagues stopped a rampaging horror from tearing through Dunwich,
        a backwater town several hours north and west of Arkham. At first you imagine this beast as a rabid
        bear, or worse, but the professor\'s description of the creature paints a different picture.\n
    \nIt all began when a man named Wilbur Whately entered the Orne Library looking for Olaus Wormius\'s Latin
        translation of a book called the <i>Necronomicon</i>. Wilbur already possessed a beaten-up English
        translation by Dr. John Dee, but it was insufficient for his purposes. Armitage turned the man away,
        fearing what use the strange man had for the book. Whateley returned in secret, hoping to steal the
        book, but was attacked by a hound guarding the university. Armitage, Rice, and Morgan later discovered
        Whateley\'s body. A description of the foul corpse - semi-anthropomorphic and covered in fur, with a
        leathery hide and greenish-grey tentacles - causes you to question whether or not Whateley was truly
        human.\n
        \nThe notes written by Dr. Armitage in the journal stress Whateley\'s
        desire to get his hands on the <i>Necronomicon</i> for some terrible purpose. As you read on, it seems
        that Dr. Armitage brought the university\'s copy of the tome to Harold Walsted - the curator of the
        Miskatonic Museum - for safekeeping in the museum\'s Restricted Hall. Although you are worried about
        your mentor, you are equally worried that Armitage\'s kidnappers might get their hands on the
        <i>Necronomicon</i>. You decide to head to the museum to prevent them from acquiring it.</string>

    <!--Scenario 3: The Essex County Express-->
    <string name="essex_setup"><b>Scenario 3: The Essex County Express</b>\n
    \nRecent events in the Museum have forced you to re-evaluate Armitage\'s tale about Dunwich. It cannot be a
    coincidence - Wilbur Whateley, the Necronomicon, the creature from Dunwich, and the people and creatures
        who attacked here in Arkham - everything must be connected. You\'re certain now where you must head:
        the lonely and dismal town of Dunwich Village.\n
    \nYou consider telling the Massachusetts State Police what you know, but the negative consequences
        outweigh the potential gain. Given the nature of your story, they would likely write your stories off
        as an absurd hoax. Worse, they could lock you up. After all, you were present in an illegal speakeasy,
        and you also trespassed in the museum. Instead, you decide to head to Dunwich yourself, in order to
        investigate further.\n
    \nYou pack everything you think you might need and manage to get some rest for the night. In the morning,
        you head to the train station in Northside and purchase a last-minute express ticket. Dunwich is
        several hours by train northwest along the Miskatonic River Valley. There is no train station in
        Dunwich, but you manage to phone one of Armitage\'s acquaintances in the small village: a man by the
        name of Zebulon Whateley who was present during the events several months ago.\n
    \nArmitage\'s notes indicate that the Whateley family is spread across many branches, some decadent and
        unscrupulous, others \"undecayed\" or otherwise untouched by nefarious and diabolic rites. According to
    Armitage, Zebulon\'s branch of the family lay somewhere between the decayed and undecayed Whateleys, who
        knew of the traditions of his ancestors, but was not corrupted by them. He agrees to pick you up at the
    closest station and drive you into town.\n
    \nAs the train departs from Arkham, you feel the events of the previous night catching up to you, and
        exhaustion sets in. But before you can safely reach your destination, the train car suddenly rumbles
        and shakes, startling you out of your reverie. The train loudly skids to a violent halt, and you hear a
    rattling noise behind you&#8230;</string>

    \nMinnie Klein, your contact at the Arkham Advertiser, had slipped you a draft of the article over a cup of
        coffee at Velma\'s Diner. It would have gone to print had Doyle Jeffries, the lead editor, not scoffed at
        the concept. \"I believe his exact words were, \'I ain\'t printing the ravings of some Voodoo lunatic
        and passing it off as news,\'\" she explained. From the sly grin spreading across her face, you could
        tell she smelled a story.\n
    \nThe headline was sensationalist. Three killings in nine days was enough to spook a town, sure. But you
        doubt all of New Orleans is gripped by terror, or even knows about the killings. Still, something
        piqued your interest. \"Lady Esprit,\" the Voodoo priestess from the article, claimed that a malign
        curse had taken root in the bayou.\n
    \n\"There\'s something to this, isn\'t there? I know that look,\" Minnie said. You weren\'t sure. If Lady
        Esprit was right, this \"roux-ga-roux\" wouldn\'t stop killing at three, that\'s for sure. But curses?

    sits back down, pouring a cup of joe for you and one for himself. \"A dame in Uptown spotted a cracked egg
        wearing this mask and holdin\' a bloody butcher\'s cleaver,\" he says, motioning to the black leather
        mask sitting on his desk. It has a comically long nose and a strange symbol scrawled in yellow on its
        forehead. \"So, she calls it in. My boys and I picked him up on the corner of Saltonstall &amp;
